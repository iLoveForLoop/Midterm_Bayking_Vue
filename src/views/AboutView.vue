    <p>
      Hey there! I’m Jeferson Bayking, your friendly neighborhood developer,
      water enthusiast, and part-time bug fixer (I swear they appear out of
      nowhere). When I’m not staring at a screen full of code, wondering why
      nothing’s working, I’m probably binge-watching tutorials or pretending to
      understand what’s going on in Stack Overflow threads.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve been on a journey through the wild world of web development, learning
      one bug at a time. Vue, React, Laravel—you name it, I’ve probably broken
      it at some point. But that’s the fun part, right? (Please say yes.)
    </p>

    <p>
      I created this site to share my coding adventures, some tips I’ve picked
      up, and maybe a few things that won’t crash your browser (no promises
      though). My goal? To keep learning, help others along the way, and one day
      write code that works on the first try—crazy, I know.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not debugging, you’ll find me enjoying the finer things in life:
      over-caffeinating, obsessing over new frameworks, and pretending I don’t
      have 10 unfinished side projects waiting for me. Thanks for stopping by!
    </p>
